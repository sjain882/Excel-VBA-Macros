### Embed Image Links

Info:

- Automatically embeds images in the place of image links

- Can be re-run over cells to "fill in gaps" non-destructively

- Saves the image with the document, instead of links which can go down

- WARNING: No undo available! Duplicate your file before proceeding

- Original source: by kresty @ https://superuser.com/a/1404121

- Reworked by me:

    - Images are no longer stretched to fill cell - now preserves aspect ratio

    - Images are now properly resized to fit perfectly inside cell

    - Images are centered in the cell if smaller than the cell

    - Macro executes on currently selected cells, rather than having to manually specify range every time

    - Code cleaned up and commented

- Example before: `LFRD 2025 Bus Previews - B4 - With Hyperlink.xlsm`

- Example after: `LFRD 2025 Bus Previews.xlsm`
