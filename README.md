### Embed Image Links

Info:

- Automatically embeds images in the place of image links

- Can be re-run over cells to "fill in gaps" non-destructively

- Works with URLs not ending in image extension, e.g, discord image link with token query param

- If you add rows/columns around imported images, the embedded images move automatically

- Saves the image with the document, instead of links which can go down

- WARNING: No undo available! Duplicate your file before proceeding

- Original source: by kresty @ https://superuser.com/a/1404121

- Reworked by me:

    - Images are no longer stretched to fill cell - now preserves aspect ratio

    - Images are now properly resized to fit perfectly inside cell

    - Images are centered in the cell if smaller than the cell

    - Macro executes on currently selected cells, rather than having to manually specify range every time

    - Code cleaned up and commented

- Example before: `LFRD 2025 Bus Previews - B4 - With Hyperlink.xlsm`

- Example after: `LFRD 2025 Bus Previews.xlsm`

If you were browsing a lot of Flickr images then opened their direct links to paste into a sheet (with Embed Image Links), but want to go back and get the original full webpage link so you can credit the author, use this bookmarklet ([source](https://www.flickr.com/groups/96035807@N00/discuss/72157721920375928/72157721920408447)):
